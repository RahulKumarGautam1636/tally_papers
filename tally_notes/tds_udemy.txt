TDS - Tax Deducted at Source - Any company and person making payment is required to deduct TDS at the source at the time if the payment amount exeeds certain
           threshold limits (notified by government). TDS has to be duducted at rates (payment nature with section codes) prescribed by tax department. The deductor also
           needed to file TDS return in quaterly statement given to the IT department.
           Create Nature of Payment - Create -> TDS nature of payment -> name (payment to contractor) -> section (194c) -> payment code (94c) -> set rates (2% - rate for 
           deductee with a pan, 20% - rate without pan) -> threshold limit (75000 - if expenses crosses total amount of 75000 in a year then TDS will be applied).
           Create Ledgers
                   1) Advertisement expenses -> indirect expenses -> TDS applicable (yes) -> nature of payment (payment to contractor) -> save and exit.
                   2) TDS a/c -> duties and taxes -> type of duty -> TDS -> nature of payment (any - if you select a specific nature of payment then TDS will applied to only that one. 
                   3) Graphic Advertisers -> sudry creditor -> TDS deductable (yes) -> deductee type (company-resident) -> deduct in same voucher (yes) -> ***Enter pan (rate-2%).
           The Entry
                   1) Purchase entry - Make a simple entry of purchase of advertisement expenses of amount 100000 from Graphic advertisers.
                   2) Deduct TDS in Journal voucher - Open journal voucher -> Autofill (Ctrl+F) -> TDS deduction -> select date/party/nature of payment -> duty ledger (TDS a/c)
                        This will fill the entry automatically where total TDS amount will be 2%(2000 - if pan is available) of total purchase amount(100000).
                   ***TDS deduction without autofill - Open journal voucher -> debit Advertisement expenses with total expense amount (100000) -> credit Graphic advertisers 
                        with 98000 (Autofilled) -> credit TDS a/c with 2000 (TDS amount).
***Look for reports -> D -> O -> TDS reports -> form 26Q -> you will find your deducted tds amount under deducted current period. 
TDS with advance payment - 
           Question -> 1) We paid Graphic designer advance of 40000 towards advertisement. 
                                  2) After few days we recieved invoice of total amount 100000 (advance+60000) towards advertisement expenses. now deduct TDS on this purchase and
                                       adjust it with the TDS already deducted on advance payment of 40000. 
            The Entry - 
                    1) Make payment entry -> Open payment voucher (***Use single entry mode) -> bank/cash -> Graphic advertisers (40000)-> TDS a/c (-800 -- minus signifies 
                         successfull duduction on TDS) -> Note the total voucher value which decreases by TDS amount (39200).
                    2) Journal Adjustment entry - Open journal voucher -> debit advertisement expenses (100000) -> credit Graphic advertisement -> adjust against advance TDS 
                         payment (yes) -> against ref (bill-40000) -> new ref -> nature of payment (payment to contractor) -> tall will automatically deduct the TDS and credited value
                         (98800) will be reduced by TDS amount (1200) -> credit TDS a/c (1200).
                         
Evaluation - TDS on advance 40000 => 40000*2% = 800
                       TDS on full payment 100000 => 100000*2% = 2000
                       Total deducted TDS value = 2000 + 800 = 2800
                       Adjusted TDS value = 2800 - 800 = 2000 ( TDS payable)
