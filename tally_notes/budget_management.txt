Budget and Scenario Management - This system is used to track and mantain budget for diffrent scenario/events. In this process we allocate some amout of money to some
                      speciefic group and ledgers for a definite interval of time and the tally tracks incomes and expneses for that ledger and group. we can see different information
                      and transaction effecting our budget for this time period in budget management reports (GOT - D - T - F10).

Example - Setting budget rs.60000 for the Daily Office Expenses of office for two months (taking 30days/month).
