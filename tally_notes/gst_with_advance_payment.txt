26) GST calculation when we recieve any advance from a debtor (future sale) -
       Since we need to file GST returns on monthly  basis hence there are two scenario that can happen in real situation.
       Scenario - 1) You can recieve advance payment in current month but the sale will be copleted (full payment and delivery of goods) in next or upcoming months. in this
            case we need to file the GST generated on the advance recieved in current month. Since transaction is not fully completed hence we will need some additional step to
            make this advance GST entry so it can be seen in our GST reports and we can pay this in current month's GST returns.
            ***Make stock item for which you're taking advance and that is to be sold in future - set GST rate (10%) on it and save.
       Step 1 - Make the Advance reciept entry in reciept voucher using advance options (Alt + J) -> advance reciept -> choose debtor -> choose stock item/service ledger -> 
                      enter advance amount (100000)-> note the taxable value(90909.10) and CGST(4545.45)/SGST(4545.45) (By default tally prime calculates the inclusive tax) ->
                      advance -> name bill like 'advance on item name' -> choose recieving a/c (bank/cash) -> accept screen.  
       Step 2 - Increase the tax liability manually - Since these advance GST entries are not included in GST returns hence we need to manullay increase the tax liability and
                      pay to the goverment. for this create a ledger named 'Tax paid  on advance recieved' under group current assets (it is our assets because it is holding our advance
                      taxes) -> include in assessble value (GST) -> appropriate to (Goods) -> method of calc (based on value).
                      Now create two more ledgers named 'SGST/CGST on advance recieved' in same way you make normal ledgers for CGST and SGST.
                      Now the Entry - Open journal voucher -> Statuary Adjustement (Alt + J) -> on a/c of advance reciepts -> debit 'Tax paid on advance recieved' with total tax(9090.90)
                      (CGST+SGST) generated in step 1 -> credit CGST/SGST on advance recieved with CGST(4545.45)/SGST(4545.45) amounts (make sure to enter half of total rate (5%)
                      and total advance amount (100000) properly otherwise it will not be visible in GST report under tax liability(advances recieved)) -> accept and save.
       Step 3 - Payment of Advance tax - Open payment voucher -> Stat adjustment (Alt + J) -> Advance payment under reverse charge -> debit 'CGST/SGST on advance recieved'
                      with CGST(4545.45)/SGST(4545.45) amount which will make its curr. balance zero -> credit Bank/cash -> accept save.
       Step 4 - Make the sale entry - Time to issue the sale bill for the debtor. Make usual entry for that selling item (price-200, units-1000pcs, total bill amouont-200000) -> apply 
                      GSTs(total-20000) -> choose against ref in in bill-wise-detail and choose bill created in step 1 and enter the amount(100000) in it -> again take new ref and adjust 
                      the remaining amount (120000) -> accept and save.
                      ***NOTE that in reality the debtor will only pay the remaining sale amount (100000), by taking against ref we included/mixed it with the advance payment (100000)
                             done by the debtor which makes total payment equal to 200000 and now we applied GST to this new total amount(200000) which gives tax value(20000).
                           since we already paid tax on advance amount (100000) hence we need to deduct paid tax (9090.90) from current tax value(20000) and it is done in next step.    
       Step 5 - Decrease the tax liability - since we already paid advance tax hence we need to decrease our current tax liability (see detailed reasons discussed above in NOTE).
                      (current generated tax(20000)- tax paid in advance(9090.90) = current tax liability(10909.10)).
                      open journal voucher -> (Alt + J) -> sales against advance reciepts voucher -> just pass reverse entry done in step 2 (debit CGST/CGST on advance recieved with their
                      values(4545.45) and credit Tax paid on advance recieved with total tax value(9090.90)) making its balance zero.
                      This decreses our tax liability we can see this in balance sheet under duties taxes with reduced tax liability(reduced from 20000 to 10909.10).
       
       Scenario - 2) In second case the sale will be completed (recieved full payment and delivered the goods) in present months.
                            ***In such cases you just need to perform Step 1 (advance reciept entry) and Step 4 (the sale entry). we don't need to do any adjustment to tax liability because at 
                                  the this entry becomes same as other normal GST entries.
