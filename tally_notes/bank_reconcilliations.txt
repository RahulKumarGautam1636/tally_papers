Reconciliation - it is a process of matching transactions that have been recorded internally against monthly statements from external sources such
                              as banks. In simple words reconcilliation is done to fix the mismatch our account books or entries with bank books or bank 
                              statements.
Reasons for mismatch - A mismatch happens when we make an entry in tally software ware but in reality that entry is completed in after a time 
                                            time interval (after few days). Ex - delayed cheque - suppose we paid with a cheque to someone and immediately made an
                                            entry to tally software but we don't know that when customer will clear this cheque. He may take few days to do so hence
                                            this will make date mismatch between our A/c books and bank statements. see few more Examples - 
                                            1) bank charges
                                            2) cheque bounce
		       3) Monthly fixed payments (EMIs)
Openin BRS (Bank Reconcilliation Statement) - Making entries of uncompleted/unconciled entries of previous months/years to current month/
                        year's unreconciled entry books. in simple words making list of previous month's/year's unconciled entries.
                        Goto banking -> bank reconcilliation -> select your bank -> opening BRS (Alt+H). Now take the list of unconciled entries and fill info.
                        date of entry -> name of party -> deposit (recieved money)/withdrawal (paid money) -> debit (if recieved)/ credit (if paid) -> cheque
                        no. (cheque1) -> date of issuing cheque (date of entry).
                        ***Now note the total closing balance and set it as opening balance for the bank ledger. 
Setting Cheque Printing - open bank ledger and fill additional details. set/alter cheque books (yes) -> set cheque details with name -> enable cheque
                                               printing (yes).
Reconcilliation - If you have bank statements of current financial period then goto bank reconcilliation in banking where we can find all the 
                              unreconciled entries. now match the entries and fill the field bank date with the date mentioned in bank statement for the respected
                              entries. 
                              1) If you don't find an entry (ex - bank charges) in your tally but it's present in bank this is a mismatch. To resolve this we'll make this
                                   entry immediately and then reconcile it. create voucher (Alt+J) -> make that entry and come bank to reconcilliation window and
                                   reconcile it by entering bank date.
                              2) If you don't find an entry (ex - a debtor didn't paid money online) in bank statement - in this case just delete this entry from your
                                   accounts books.
***When Reconcilliation of all entries are completed then note the final closing balances of accounts books and bank statement. If they are found 
                  equal then reconcilliation is completed successfully, if not then we may have comitted any mistake in the process.
