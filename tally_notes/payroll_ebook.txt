   Formula used for Calulation - Gratuity Calculation in India -

						= (Basic Pay + DA) x Years of service x 15/26
		  2) Monthly Gratuity - Monthly Salary x 4.81%
   Pay Head Cretion - Name (Gratuity) -> Pay head type (Gratuity) -> Days (26) -> From 1 to 60 set 0, from 61 to 120 set 15, from 121 and above set 15. -> curr. liabilty.
