IMPORT OF ITEMS/SERVICES WITH GST (purchasing from international creditor)
***IMPORT is charged under RCM system - since in this case the seller is an international entity which is most possibly not registered under any taxing system in india.
      hence they cannot forced to pay tax under FCM which makes RCM only way to charge the taxes.
Questions - company imports internet installation services from Shree shyam supplies (canada) worth 100000. pass the entry and pay the tax to government. Also take/
                      evaluate input tax credit (ITC).
Create Ledgers - 
             1) Creditor (shree shyam supplies) -> sundry creditors -> country (canada).
             2) Tax paid under RCM -> current assets -> include in assesable value calculation for (GST) -> appropriate to (services) -> method of calc (based on value). 
             3) Create normal IGST and 'IGST on RCM' ledger under duties and taxes in usual way (creating two defferent ledgers for clear view in balance sheet).
Step 1 - Make Purchase Entry - make a normal purchase entry of worth 100000 but don't apply IGST ledger here (because it's is charged under RCM). IGST is still applied 
               behind the scene we can see this in tax analysis (notice the note in left-bottom of tax analysis window).
               Check correctness - look for your entry in GSTR-2 under import of services -> balance liability.
Step 2 - Increase Tax Liability - Since RCM taxes are not charged in the purchase invoice (normal manner) hence it is not shown in balance sheet which means we have no
               liability (credit value) on our IGST ledgers hence we need to manually create liability on IGST ledger with help of 'Tax paid under RCM (current assets)' ledger.
               The Entry - Open journal voucher -> Alt+J -> type of duty (GST) -> nature of adjustment (increase of tax liability) -> additional details (import of services) -> debit
               'Tax paid under RCM' with tax amount (18000) and credit 'IGST on RCM' (18000 - must enter rate - 18% and taxable value - 100000 of original purchase).
               Check correctness - look for your entry in GSTR-2 under import of services -> booked liability.
Step 3 - Payment of GST - since our 'IGST on RCM' ledger which is GST ledger is now in credit value, we can use this to pay the tax.
               Open payment voucher - Autofill (Ctrl+F) -> payment type (recipient liability) -> debit 'IGST on RCM' with 18000 -> credit cash/bank (18000).
Step 4 - Increase of Input Tax Credit -  
               Open journal voucher - Alt+J -> GST -> nature of payment (increase of input tax credit) -> additional details (import of services)  -> debit IGST ledger with 18000 
               -> credit 'Tax paid under RCM' with 18000 -> save and exit.
               This leaves IGST ledger in debit balance which we can use it to reduce our upcoming taxes (availing ITC).
