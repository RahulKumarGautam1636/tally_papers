DA = calculated on basic salary and added to employee salary to mitigate the impact of inflation on people. 
HRA = 30% of (basic pay + DA).
PF = if basic pay is less than 6500 then PF is 12% of earned basic pay else it will be rs.780.             [earned basic = current month's earning after eliminating leaves/absent]
EPS = 8.33% of basic pay if basic pay is less than 6500 else rs.541.
EPF(3.67% of basic pay) = PF(12%) - EPS(8.33%)
Professional tax = Tax amount is Zero if current months total earning is less than 5000, rs.175 if it's between 5001-10000 and 200
                                 or 300 if greater than 10000. Tax amount is deducted and deposited to the bank by the employer.
